# Gousto coding test

Hi there! We prepared a technical task so we can get to know you better. Below you will find scenarios and further details on what this task is about.

If anything is unclear or you have any questions, feel free to get back to us. We want to make our technical task a pleasant experience so feel free to give us any feedback on this exercise.

## How to use:

### Prerequisites:

* `node js` >= 8.12
* `yarn` (you can install it globally by running `npm install -g yarn`)

### Commands:

* `yarn install` - installing dependencies
* `yarn start` - starting the app in dev mode
* `yarn build` - build the production artifacts
* `yarn test` - running the tests

## How to deliver your assessment

* Please fork/clone this repository to your own version control platform (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc.) and send us the link to it
* We will pay attention to the commits to see how the work was structured

## Functional requirements

  * When I type ' serv' in the input search
  * Then the products matching the search input in title and/or description are shown below

### Task 5: As a user I want to be able to see the product description when I click on the product name
  
  * Given that I am a user and I land on main page
  * When I click on 'Borsao Macabeo'

* For cross origin accessibility you can use [cross-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-fetch) that is already installed in package.json.

## Non-Functional Requirements 

* UI should be built with React, but you are allowed to use additional other libraries if needed
* Use your preferred library for state management (Redux dependencies are already set up, but you can use what you want)
* Use your preferred CSS solution/library. Use your imagination, but do not spend to much time for css
* The application should be responsive (the application can be used on mobile)
* The code should be production ready (i.e. include tests)

## Help us to understand your solution

* In order to understand better you solution we would like to see the following sections in a Readme:
    * `How to use`: details about how to use your solution(if anything different from what we added)
    * `Application structure`: explain the architecture - feel free to change the base structure from this test
    * `A list of missing functional requirements`: if any, and explain why you didn't complete them
    * `Possible improvements/ functionality`: anything that you wished you could've added if you had more time
